Afterwards I had job as sys admin (maintaining windows server, active directory, and updating ASP.NET site on IIS). After that I was hired as a web developer, developing a complex multipage webshops, focusing on SEO and “sales gamification”, earning points in some sort of pyramid game.

Now I do a lot of work in database design, backend development of GraphQL API to power modern front-ends in React/Relay (web) and React Native via Expo (mobile). Along with this I have a great deal of experience in devOps as well, in terms of administrating and orchestrating Docker containers in Kubernetes. Before the container movement I have setup a lot of Linux servers, with provision through Ansible, and monitoring via Sensu and Prometheus.
